&quot;The video is an extension of Derrick’s project for Headmaster No. 8. The issue is thematically structured around the Village People, and he was asked to consider the importance of the police uniform in relation to authority. At the time, the editors had no idea that Derrick would soon be involved in a late-night altercation with the Chicago PD after leaving a gay bar, or that he would use his assignment to reconnect with a boyhood friend, now a police officer, whom he hadn’t seen in many years. The Roach Is Coming is based on a recording of the intimate conversation between Derrick and his childhood friend, recorded as Derrick and the other man bathed one another.&quot;",Link,,,07/03/2018 12:17:41 PM, ,723,723,0,1036,1036,0,37,24,40,0,0,444,283,0,0,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,22.0,1.0,2,27.0,2.0,19,13.0,,,27,13.0,,,,,RIC|RIC
