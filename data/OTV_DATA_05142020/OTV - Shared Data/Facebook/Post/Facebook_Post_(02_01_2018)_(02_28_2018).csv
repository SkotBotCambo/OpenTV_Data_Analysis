When Demetra, a competitive professional, is forced to reevaluate her social life, she strikes up a friendship with Cymone, her seemingly much cooler coworker. As their worlds collide to form a brand new #squad, these five young Chicagoans begin to reevaluate their own identities as well as their relationships to each other. By weaving together public and private experiences, VELVET comedically explores the joys, vulnerabilities, and everything in-betweens of making new friends in your mid-twenties. 

VELVET is created by Allie Dunn, Leo J Gilbert, Dru Greenwood, Tyla Landry, Sydney Levison, Clifton Lyons, and Becky Schultz.

Nupita Obama is the alter ego of Curtis (Mister Wallace), cast out of her relationship with Reyes (Kiam Marcelo Junio), because their new lover, Gia (Saya Naomi), is moving in and Curtis can’t afford to move out. Curtis creates Nupita to diffuse the tension.

Saya Naomi performed a version of her drag persona, but also did makeup and styling. &quot;Vogua&quot; demonstrates how much &quot;production value&quot; queer artists of color can bring to television.

Though they may not like each other, their survival depends on their cooperation. 

&quot;What I guess the show is about a kind of a fairy tale or allegory and part-handbook of how we can all get free. And how we are implicated in each other’s liberation.” - creator Ricardo Gamboa

In this episode of #BrujosTV the New World Colonizers are closing in and violence is hitting close to the brujos. Here we see the different ways they are dealing with the trauma, and not all the ways are healthy. 

Writer Ricardo Gamboa on the newest brujo:
&quot;The young boy that appears, played by Victor Krazi Musoni, who’s a sleep talker—that was influenced by a young autistic boy that disappeared when I first moved to New York, and further motivated by the Laquan McDonald shooting and the shooting of black men that were happening around the country.&quot;
