&quot;The Right Swipe might, for some audiences, seem trivial by reducing its content to a mere social push for a more comprehensive understanding of underrepresented voices. However, for those who have a thirst for more representation, this show will deliver a nuanced understanding of dating. This show has the potential to stand out for how it can make marginalized groups of people feel. It can give voice to the voiceless, allowing those to be seen who do not often get to be seen. This show might be able ‚Äî if given the chance and the opportunity ‚Äî to encourage us to see ourselves a bit more in the overlooked communities, cultures, and in these characters.‚Äù",Link,,,01/20/2020 03:32:35 PM, ,466,466,0,487,487,0,24,13,15,0,0,443,422,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,,,16,,,9,4.0,,,11,4.0,,,None

To incentivize participation and spur creation of Chicago-based projects, we are announcing the 2nd annual class of our OTV FELLOWS program is now open to applicants! Fellows will receive a stipend of $6,000-8,000 to develop a pitch for an original television series or film as they take courses in the new OTV Study Hall. These projects will be exhibited during our second annual OTV x Sundance: Emerging Storytellers of Chicago initiative taking place in August 2020.

Visit weareo.tv/otv-fellows for more details!

DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 15

The OTV STUDY HALL is designed to develop strong writers, directors and independent producers who identify with multiple communities that have been historically marginalized in the film &amp; TV business because of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, class, disability or citizenship status. More details to come! RSVPs will open March 15.

We have to thank Pop Culture Collab for funding these programs!
