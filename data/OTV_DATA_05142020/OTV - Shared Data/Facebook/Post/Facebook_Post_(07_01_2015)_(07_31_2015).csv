A huge congrats to the entire crew behind YST for receiving the highest granted sum from the Chicago Digital Media Production Fund, $19,000, and to all the other grantees!

A special thanks to Chicago Filmmakers and the Voqal Fund for supporting independent artists in #Chicago! #OpenTV proudly presented season one and we can't wait to show you what we have in store for season two of YST! 


&quot;The Production Fund allows us to support artists who are creating work with the intention of sparking meaningful conversations around social change...The projects of the eight media artists receiving grants exhibit a range of compelling ideas. They include a narrative web series that tells unapologetically authentic stories through characters who are as diverse as they are genuine.&quot;
