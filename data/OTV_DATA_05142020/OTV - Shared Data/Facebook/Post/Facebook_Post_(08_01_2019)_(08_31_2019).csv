&quot;We want to push the subject matter a bit further; we want more queer sex and nudity, more recreational drug use, trans representation, more celebrations of black and brown bodies absent of trauma and tragedy.

&quot;We‚Äôve been contacted by a few networks and production companies in Hollywood who are interested in seeing Damaged Goods developed into a TV series, but before we‚Äôre thrown into the world of strenuous development deals, we want to continue to make art for the sake of art. Hollywood can wait, we want to continue to create this series for our community first.&quot;",Link,,,08/28/2019 01:11:25 PM, ,609,609,0,782,782,0,26,14,18,0,0,734,583,0,0,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,14.0,2.0,,14.0,2.0,9,6.0,,,12,6.0,,,,,DG|DG

We brought 2 seasoned filmmakers and 3 executives at studios in Hollywood to talk to and connect with 30+ Chicago-based writers and directors. Sponsored by Hannibal Buress, hosted by the Lilly and Lana Wachowskis' studio Kinowerks, Reunion Chicago and Stage 18 Chicago, we brought Hollywood to Chicago and Chicago back to Hollywood.

OTV is a wholly Black queer/trans/femme-run platform representing everyone from South Asian Americans, disabled/crip folx, women of color, immigrants, first-gen, Latinx and trans people. Intersectionality is a Black feminist framework that is far from marginal. It's EVERYTHING WE NEED!

Jenna Anast produced this two-day event with a level of intentionality that blew the minds of our guests from Hollywood. Chris Walker and Eli Micky held it together on the event production side, and Stephanie Jeter stepped up to pitch our plan for a studio arm. We had incredible interns Ahlaam Delange, Vynique Moon, Elsa Medhin, Sydnee Johnson, Lauren Milan Rausaw, Kamari Marie to hold us down. 

All the food was hyperlocal and much of it farm-to-table (CHICAGO farm to table from the #LetUsBreathe Collective). We did a screening of amazing Chicago-produced work. We operated under organically crafted brave space agreements. We gave artists pitch training, 1-on-1 and group meetings. We hosted a panel on producing in Chicago with former Illinois Film Office managing director and Kartemquin Films executive director Betsy Steinberg, Cinecares Foundation executive director Sheila R. Brown, and indie producers Karla Huffman Barry and Brian Khan. We offered exclusive sneak peeks of upcoming series #GoodGenes by Tribble Tribble and Codeswitched by Karan Sunil. WE EVEN PREMIERED A NEW TALK SHOW, Craft Service, starring Jenna and Hannibal!!

Thank you so much to our artist and industry advisors for sharing your time, expertise, and warmth: Eva Vives, Andrew Ahn, Makiah Green, Christine Davila, and Sara Rastogi. Thank you to our partners Lyft and Ace Hotel Chicago for supporting this dream. 

We can build the world we want but only in solidarity with those of us who may face greater challenges but innovate new beautiful stories and paradigms from our unique experiences. #weareotv

‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going to show these characters than we need to show their sex lives. I always go back to the romantic comedy genre and the gay best friend trope. They‚Äôre usually sexless characters. If our whole thesis is taking those characters and putting them at the forefront of the romantic comedy, then they should be having as much sex as their straight, white counterparts in the genre.‚Äù",Link,,,08/19/2019 01:00:17 PM, ,599,599,0,822,822,0,54,26,37,2,2,777,568,0,0,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,32.0,3.0,2,34.0,3.0,19,10.0,,,27,10.0,,,2,2,None
