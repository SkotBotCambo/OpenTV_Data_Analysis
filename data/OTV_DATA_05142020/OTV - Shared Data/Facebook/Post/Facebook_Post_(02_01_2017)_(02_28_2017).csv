Brujos blends the Latin American soap opera, American sitcom, and critical theory as it follows a coven of four queer Latino doctoral candidates as they learn magic, indulge in nightlife, navigate intimate relationships, and write seminar papers all while trying to survive a witch-hunt. These young protagonists confront histories and realities of racial and gendered inequality as they battle the secret society of white, heteronormative male descendants of the first New World colonizers behind the witch-hunt.

In the script, there are all these moments at the end of the episodes where we get to have really vulnerable, quiet moments with one or two of the characters. I remember circling that when I first read it — this is a theme that keeps happening and it’s something that’s both tragic and really relatable to the experience of all women of color and people of color across the board. We don’t have representations of ourselves going through these really tumultuous times in our 20s and teens that it can feel lonely and like you don’t have anyone who can relate to you.&quot; - Samantha Bailey for Vimeo

The crew controls the mechanics of how the show is shot and seen. And when I worked in theater, even if there was a racially diverse show onstage, that diversity was rarely represented by the crew. The excuse I heard over and over again was, “Oh we can’t find talented enough people from diverse backgrounds.” That’s just completely false. What we wanted to do was create an amazing crew, all masters in their own craft, on this show. We wanted to have a crew that reflected the diversity of the cast and story, as well as the people creating art from various communities in Chicago. And so we did.

&quot;Brown Girls uses speech as a prism through which visibility and acceptance are refracted. Crucially, it identifies—and sometimes elides—the boundaries between self-love and one’s place among friends and family. When Leila speaks to her aunt, her voice bears the telltale accent that South Asian Americans reserve for conversations with immigrant relatives and family friends. It reemerges when she tries to convince Mussarat that she knows how to make dhal and roti, then vanishes in the company of Patricia and their friend Victor, who watch in horror as she clocks her ex’s new girlfriend in the face. This code-switching allows Leila to frame and reframe her identity as she moves between relationships and communities. Sometimes subtle and often awkward, this reframing allows both her and Patricia to achieve a deeper knowledge of themselves and their communities.&quot;",Link,,,02/15/2017 01:06:46 PM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,15,1.0,,,,,,None

They instantly hit it off, attending on-campus events together, studying together, and eventually moving in together. While living with two other college friends in Providence, they built a meaningful support system. After graduation, the pair moved to Woods's hometown, Chicago, to explore the city's artistic community. That time in their lives and the bond they formed is at the center of Brown Girls.&quot;
