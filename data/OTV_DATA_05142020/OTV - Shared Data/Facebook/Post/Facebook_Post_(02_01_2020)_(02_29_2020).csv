- 
Rebba Amaris is a Chicago-based writer and educator living in historic Hyde Park. Rebba believes the black-radical imagination is expansive and varied. In her independent praxis as an emerging-queer video artist seeking imaginative self-determination, Rebba writes from a dissenting space of provocation that questions harmonious narratives of a colorblind present. Her work interrogates the intersections of collective &amp; individual healing, as she navigates her position within post-modernity as an experimental artist in play &amp; writer by medium. She graduated from the University of Chicago (MA ’15) and Rice University (BA, ’12). As a practice-led researcher in conversation with the unquantifiable— she hopes to articulate how healing and destructive salons transcend digital vs analog binaries.
