After thanking Full Spectrum Features, Periscope Post &amp; Audio, Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, Voqal and Chicago Filmmakers, he read an excerpt of this speech Bea and Daniel prepared:

&quot;We, the creators, are a trans woman and queer Black man from opposite sides of Chicago. We both grew up without any sense of who we were, or who we could grow up to be. Such alienation from your actual self leaves a lasting, destructive impact. It took many years for either of us to even recognize the harm we internalized from measuring ourselves up to the only, impossible images that were accessible to us. Only more recently have we begun to see the validity in ourselves as we come, and it is a gift we wish to share as much as possible.

We once heard a gay activist use the term 'reverse diaspora' to describe the LGBTQ community. 'We are born scattered, then find each other,' he said. Often queer folks need to seek out chosen family and build homes and community that can hold space for every part of us in the ways the larger world will not. This is the shape of our show: our characters separately struggle to stand in their own full truths, but they increasingly find family amongst each other, and those bonds hopefully allow them to grow stronger, make wiser decisions, and live more authentically.

It is this reverse diaspora that led the two of us to work together although the logics of the most segregated city in the country intended to keep us apart. We created #theTTV in this spirit of unlikely family, in the hopes we inspire others to do so themselves, and to stand in their own full truths.&quot;
