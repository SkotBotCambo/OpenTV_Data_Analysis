When we last saw our gay Latino witches they'd just realized they were being hunted by the descendants of colonizers. Join us at Brujos Series World Premiere November 9 at the National Museum of Mexican Art to watch the stirring conclusion of Ricardo Gamboa and Reshmi Hazra Rustebakke's dramatic series. Tickets support the production team who worked hard to bring back the series just 8 months after premiering the first 4 episodes, available at http://brujostv.com
