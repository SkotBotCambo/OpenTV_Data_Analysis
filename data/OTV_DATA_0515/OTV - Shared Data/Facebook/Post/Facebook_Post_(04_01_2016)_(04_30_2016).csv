&quot;I am a mover....

I am interested in the symbolic nature of the performative act of moving ones body.

I am deeply invested in and often obsessed with the act and process of moving, the change of place, production of space, position, and the clarity/meaning gleaned from the shifting of perspective. My practice is rooted in harnessing the power of movement as a mode of reclamation: of the body, story, identity, and truth.&quot;",Link,,,04/21/2016 09:14:21 AM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,2,2.0,,,,,,,,,,None

Here in #Chicago, we have an excellent crew: they’re like a small extended family, and there is such a wealth of talent in terms of actors, comedians, and dancers. We also like that, at least in terms of independent projects, there are more open ways of doing things here than in other cities.

We once hosted a group of L.A. actors for a shoot, and they were completely flummoxed by the way we worked, from our small yet effective crews, to the fact that everyone on set was considered (and treated) equally. In more rigidly codified environments, it’s harder to alter the system. Though, I hear Jill Soloway is dismantling the way things are done quite a bit on the set of Transparent, and we hope to see more of that: sets that are inclusive and supportive, making the most of each person’s true skills rather than labeling them and keeping them in a certain role.

This is a musical, movement, spiritual + intellectual exercise for me. Sometimes when I’m practicing I record myself and share the videos online. I have developed an artistic practice to return daily to this exercise. I love my radical, black, queer, gender non-conforming existence. The world doesn't. I organize. I protest. I teach. I love.
