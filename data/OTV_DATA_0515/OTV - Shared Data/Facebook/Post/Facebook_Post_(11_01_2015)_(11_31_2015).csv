This short film is dedicated to people who are struggling with the grips of depression and wondering if there is a way out. &quot;In Let Go and Let God&quot; she finds her release through dance. The movement stirs her soul to the point where it brings her back to life and she makes a commitment to live again, to take back her power and move forward walking in the joy that God intended her to have for her life.
