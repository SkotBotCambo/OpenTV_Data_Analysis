Over the next few months, Miles will work directly with Eli Micky &amp; the Open Television tribe to bring our multimedia campaigns to life! Miles will support our Activation Officer as we upgrade OTV's creative vision with a dash of the bizarre and a sprinkle of divinity. 

Emy was born in Hotlanta, and moved to Chicago to explore his identity and craft. His multimedia art practice includes: animation, short film, digital art, and painting. He has been fortunate to work with brands like Under Armor and Balenciaga as a content creator &amp; video coordinator. Emy uses digital materials to craft new worlds with imagery that challenges the sensory to experience the world in alternative ways.
