Chicago based artist co-op, &quot;The Exquisite Corpse,&quot; has one week to come up with rent on threat of eviction. When the roommates decide to throw a huge &quot;let's make-rent&quot; arts fundraiser at the end of the week, all four roommates (Lee, Lizzard, Tre, and Sam) go into a frenzy trying to organize an event that will go down in DIY history. Amidst the chaos, Sam's yuppie sister, Dusty, seeks asylum from her quarter life-crisis spurred by on by the death of her dog Paul. Sam and Tre try to navigate the world of polyamory vs. monogamy, Lee begins a career as a drag queen, and Lizzard falls in love with an unexpected person. The Exquisite Corpse follows one week in the lives of these disparate personalities, with shifting perspectives, as they try to navigate love, family, art, and the acute need to make rent.

&quot;I wanted to visually show a story from dark to light. So from this point of conflict to redemption. So we did that with colors, I chose colors to focus on in every scene, but I always wanted it to be that I was this soothsayer or this prophet that could see it all. So that’s where this ancestral realm kind of comes from. I [also] wanted to bring some light and humor to this betrayal that can be very dark and devastating experience. Plus I wanted to tap into myself and sort of this inner knowing of like “you know and you decided to ignore these red flags that were popping up because you were so desperate to have ‘a friend.’&quot;

It's like Maya Angelou says: when somebody tells you who they are, believe them. But also in the video when she goes through the healing process, because she does heal, that’s her tapping into the divine feminine energy that we all have inside of ourselves.&quot;

BSAYF will be featured in OTV's upcoming pilot &quot;Hair Story.&quot; Catch a sneak peek at the The Art Institute of Chicago March 30. Details here: http://www.artic.edu/event/gallery-talk-and-screening-artists-connect-open-tv

#Seedsseries is a comedic, socially conscious web series from Deja Harrell, following the misadventures of four young black women.

#Yogma follows a hopeful, young yoga instructor who dreams of being a bright star in a beautiful culture finds out that her rise to the top, and the world shes fighting to be a part of... aren't exactly what she thought they'd be. Series created by Karla Huffman. (Gypsy Yoga)

&quot;I wanted to give voice to me being black and feminine, and a lot of people probably wouldn’t but that’s who I am, that’s how I felt and that’s how I grew up. That’s who &quot;Blackie&quot; is. Just from the times growing up being online seeing “no blacks, no fats, no femmes,” and I’m like damn I’m all of those.  And just noticing that black femmes have saved us. They have given us a soul and given birth to so many of us. So my grandmother’s voice is on there, Jenifer Lewis’s voice is on there, James Baldwin, who to me is black and feminine, is on there.&quot; - ROY KINSEY 

BSAYF stars Saya Naomi and Mister Wallace as a spin-off to #NupitaObama. It was produced by our founder Aymar Jean Christian, who created and directed the &quot;Hair Story&quot; pilot with an amazing team of writer-performers.

Happy #InternationalWomensDay! This cycle we have a whole host of bomb women filmmakers. VELVET is based on the rreal-lifefriendship between two of the shows co-creators, Allie Dunn and Tyla Landry, who met in 2016 as co-workers at a minority-owned financial firm in Chicago. 

When Demetra, a competitive professional, is forced to reevaluate her social life, she strikes up a friendship with Cymone, her seemingly much cooler coworker. As their worlds collide to form a brand new #squad, these five young Chicagoans begin to reevaluate their own identities as well as their relationships to each other. By weaving together public and private experiences, VELVET comedically explores the joys, vulnerabilities, and everything in-betweens of making new friends in your mid-twenties.",Video,,,03/08/2018 01:15:14 PM, ,451,451,0,664,664,0,64,59,71,0,0,407,269,0,0,17,23,28,0,0,125,154,0,0,0,47102,12,2.0,,14,2.0,,18,,44.0,,22,,49.0,,,,,,VT|TEX|VT|VT|VT
