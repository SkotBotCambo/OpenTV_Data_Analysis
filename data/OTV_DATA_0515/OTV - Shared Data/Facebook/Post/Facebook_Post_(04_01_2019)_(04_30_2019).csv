#OTVTonight is a wrap and my heart is full! Last week's screening was more proof that Chicago artists are making the best indie TV in the country and representing our diversity more than any channel in Hollywood -- in front of and behind the camera! 

Don't believe me? Come see for yourself as the projects premiere online and in Chicago during #OTVWednesdays this spring: http://facebook.com/weareotv/events

First I want to thank the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago for hosting us for the third year in a row, and to January Parkos Arnall, Christy LeMaster and the entire public programs team. We're so very grateful to the Chicago Reader, Free Write Arts &amp; Literacy, Humboldt House, Mainstream Media, LLC, and People Who Care for partnering with us to make this happen. 

Eli Micky and Jenna Anast deserve a big round of applause for producing this event, with Elijah also designing our beautiful set! Many thanks to Chris Walker and Ahlaam Delange for providing essential support, and to Elsa Medhin, Dio Aldridge, Kinidee Lanier, Alex Advocaat, and Lena Elmeligy for their assistance in the production.

I'm so lucky to have had Hijo Pr√≥digo back as our DJ who keeps us bopping during our pre-show, post-show and commercial breaks, and Karla Huffman-Barry gave me life during our trap yoga intermission! 

Finally, thank you to the teams behind The Right Swipe, Damaged Goods, FOBia Series, and #goodenoughtv and our esteemed moderators Sam Bailey, Fatimah Asghar, Isaac Gomez, and Eva Saha Daniel for bringing your brilliance to OTV!

The future of TV is intersectional!
