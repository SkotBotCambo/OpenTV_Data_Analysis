Happy #InternationalWomensDay! This cycle we have a whole host of bomb women filmmakers. VELVET is based on the rreal-lifefriendship between two of the shows co-creators, Allie Dunn and Tyla Landry, who met in 2016 as co-workers at a minority-owned financial firm in Chicago. 

When Demetra, a competitive professional, is forced to reevaluate her social life, she strikes up a friendship with Cymone, her seemingly much cooler coworker. As their worlds collide to form a brand new #squad, these five young Chicagoans begin to reevaluate their own identities as well as their relationships to each other. By weaving together public and private experiences, VELVET comedically explores the joys, vulnerabilities, and everything in-betweens of making new friends in your mid-twenties.",Video,,,"03/08/2018 01:15:14 PM"," "," ",,0,,664,451,154,125,39,31,28,23,0,0,127,27,25,14,19,9,0,664,0,154,0,39,0,28,0.974,0.9805,0.9481,0.8247,0.5909,0.461,0.4156,0.3831,0.3377,0.3117,0.2922,0.2532,0.2403,0.2338,0.2403,0.2273,0.2143,0.2078,0.2013,0.1818,0.1818,0.1818,0.1883,0.1753,0.1623,0.1623,0.1623,0.1558,0.1494,0.1494,0.1558,0.1558,0.1558,0.1494,0.1429,0.1299,0.1234,0.1104,0.0909,0.0584,0.0455,0.9685,0.9764,0.9528,0.8031,0.5433,0.3937,0.3386,0.3071,0.252,0.2283,0.2047,0.1654,0.1496,0.1417,0.1417,0.1339,0.126,0.126,0.126,0.1102,0.1102,0.1102,0.1181,0.1024,0.0945,0.0945,0.0945,0.0866,0.0787,0.0787,0.0866,0.0866,0.0866,0.0866,0.0866,0.0709,0.0709,0.063,0.0472,0.0315,0.0236,1,1,0.9259,0.9259,0.8148,0.7778,0.7778,0.7407,0.7407,0.7037,0.7037,0.6667,0.6667,0.6667,0.7037,0.6667,0.6296,0.5926,0.5556,0.5185,0.5185,0.5185,0.5185,0.5185,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4815,0.4444,0.4074,0.4074,0.3704,0.3333,0.2963,0.1852,0.1481,49,,22,44,,18,,14,2,,12,2

It's a colorful and eccentric shared space, where the drive for generating radical and loving work is only mitigated by the fact that humans live there, with all the realities that come with that like hygiene, personal space, sex, and, oh yeah, rent.

The Exquisite Corpse is created by Abby Pierce and Cassidy Slaughter-Mason. See the premiere March 28th:

&quot;I wanted to visually show a story from dark to light. So from this point of conflict to redemption. So we did that with colors, I chose colors to focus on in every scene, but I always wanted it to be that I was this soothsayer or this prophet that could see it all. So that’s where this ancestral realm kind of comes from. I [also] wanted to bring some light and humor to this betrayal that can be very dark and devastating experience. Plus I wanted to tap into myself and sort of this inner knowing of like “you know and you decided to ignore these red flags that were popping up because you were so desperate to have ‘a friend.’&quot;

It's like Maya Angelou says: when somebody tells you who they are, believe them. But also in the video when she goes through the healing process, because she does heal, that’s her tapping into the divine feminine energy that we all have inside of ourselves.&quot;

BSAYF will be featured in OTV's upcoming pilot &quot;Hair Story.&quot; Catch a sneak peek at the The Art Institute of Chicago March 30. Details here: http://www.artic.edu/event/gallery-talk-and-screening-artists-connect-open-tv
