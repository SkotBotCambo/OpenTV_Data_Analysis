This is your opportunity to get the inside scoop on how Open TV is developing innovative queer television. If you’re new to Open TV, you might want to read our origin story and the previous report from halfway cycle one. The first report includes what I look for when I receive pitches and how we develop programming.

This report marks the end of the first cycle of programming. What’s a cycle? It’s kind of like a “season” of TV. Increasingly, TV is released all year round, not in seasons, but I still think there’s value in taking a break.

Open TV’s first cycle of original programming ran from March 2015 to July 2016 as we built up our content library. The second cycle begins January 31st at the Museum of Contemporary Chicago, where we will screen the pilots for our new original series! Before then we are going into “re-runs” with the debut of Open TV Re-Presents, starting with Kalup Linzy’s epic MoMA-set black queer drama, Melody Set Me Free!",Link,,,01/09/2017 12:00:01 PM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,4,4.0,,,,,,,,OTV|OTV|OTV|OTV|OTV|MSMF
