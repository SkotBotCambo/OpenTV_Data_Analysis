&quot;It's really important to me that this is not just a gay show, or a Latino show, because gay people and Latino people don't occur in a vacuum, they live in an ecosystem of a world that's contoured by multiple identities. When entitled gay men write 'no Blacks, no Latinos, no Asians, no fats' on their Grindr profiles, we're responding with a show centered on those excluded people.&quot; -- Ricardo Gamboa

&quot;It was in church that day that I wrote the outline for my second film 'Let Go &amp; Let God.' I wanted to document a woman’s journey of battling the grief and depression after burying the pain for so long. We come in on the time period where everything explodes and she chooses to rise....I know there is a woman who feels that she is struggling in this experience alone. I wrote this piece and created this film to tell you that you are not alone.&quot;",Link,,,10/25/2016 10:12:08 AM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3.0,,OTV

&quot;I really try to make the crew working behind the camera reflect the stories we’re telling in front of it.
