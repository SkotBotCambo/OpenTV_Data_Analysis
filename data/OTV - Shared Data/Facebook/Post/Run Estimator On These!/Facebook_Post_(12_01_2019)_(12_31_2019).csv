“Tracie Roberson is the epitome of a she-should-have-her-own-show personality, so thank goodness she does.” - UNEVERYTHING

“The visual impact of the colorful, gorgeously framed shots in this VAM Studio production is in itself enough to enjoy. But the compelling, relatably flawed characters who fill out the stunning scenes are what make Damaged Goods required viewing.” - DAMAGED GOODS",Link,,,"12/06/2019 11:31:55 PM"," ",658,658,0,673,673,0,164,55,79,0,0,442,436,0,0,76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,120,6,3,131,8,37,24,,55,24,

“Much handled things are always soft” unearths the unwritten and undocumented histories of public sex culture in the south-side of Chicago. Through conversation with longterm survivor Patric McCoy, the film traces the height of activity in the 1970s, the downfall of cruising culture in the 1980s, and the prevailing summer heat, which continues to linger. Together, McCoy and Woods-Morrow reflect on their relationship to cruising, to photography, and to each other; attempting to bridge the gap between what was, and what still remains to be explored.",Link,,,"12/02/2019 07:36:18 PM"," ",316,316,0,331,331,0,13,7,7,0,0,303,290,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,6,,,6,,2,5,,2,5,
