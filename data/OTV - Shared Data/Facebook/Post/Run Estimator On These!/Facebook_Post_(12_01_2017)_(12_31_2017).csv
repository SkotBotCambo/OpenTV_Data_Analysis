“On its surface, this supernatural web series reads like a brown and queer riff on magic-driven shows like Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and well, Supernatural. But that doesn’t do justice to what Gamboa and his Chicago-based crew is up to. With a keen academic eye to issues of colonialism, disenfranchisement, queer problematics, and infused with a lived-in knowledge of brujería and Santería, this Zodiac sign-structured show about witches being hunted by privileged, wealthy white men is as potent an allegory for the insidious way white supremacy works in erasing and colonizing black and brown bodies in the 21st century as you’ll find.”",Link,,,"12/22/2017 02:50:25 PM"," ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,3,2

&quot;Native Chicagoans Cordelia and Kyri were selected for their originality and commitment to telling stories that are unique to Chicago,&quot; said Commissioner Mark Kelly, Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events. &quot;We are excited to have two award-winning artists as our Filmmakers in Residence this year and look forward to seeing the forward-thinking series they are planning to produce.&quot;

In #TheTTV former-lovers-and-now-best-friends Jo and Carter are looking for love--it's not going well.

Thanks for the shout-out. 

&quot;While the credits of the writers, actors, and comedians featured in the documentary demonstrate how many things have changed since the 1990s, this improvement in South Asian representation hasn’t just been remedied by the forward march of time. Asian-American media advocacy has pushed for not only more and better representations of Asian Americans in film and television, but also greater representation of people of color behind the scenes. These activist-driven production and policy shifts in the film and television industries have fostered ways for some people of color to have a seat at the table and sometimes an actual platform to be seen and heard.

&quot;Under these new proposed conditions, it is difficult to imagine web series like The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl and Brown Girls having the wide audiences they did, much less HBO contracts being given to their creators to build off their initial work.&quot;

Tell the FCC to safeguard spaces for diversity and innovation. Make your voice heard at http://gofccyourself.com!",Link,,,"12/12/2017 10:07:49 AM"," ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,
