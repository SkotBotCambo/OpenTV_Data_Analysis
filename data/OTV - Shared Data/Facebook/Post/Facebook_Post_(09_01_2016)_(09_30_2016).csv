1) Consent is sexy and mandatory

TRUE - The pool is wide. Yet after excluding people for decades they will not have the &quot;right credits&quot; and work history to meet the standards set at a time of exclusion. 

FALSE - The pool is not deep. There are tons of great writers out there, but they have to be developed, cultivated, invested in. There are playwrights, novelists, poets, indie filmmakers and artists in other genres who have stories tell. But diversity programs aren't enough because it's not a real shot. People need funding and training to tell their own stories. Without funding for production, diversity talk is just lip service.
