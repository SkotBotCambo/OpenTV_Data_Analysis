&quot;Since I see the world through a strategic design lens I think that problems are pleasant opportunities waiting to be discovered. Aymar Jean Christian, the creator of Open TV approached me with a specific design problem in the late fall of 2014. As I reference my notes from the brief phone call I instantly remember resonating with a particular question that he posed: &quot;How can we build a television network that is completely open, yet sustainable?&quot; &quot;

#2QIK is much more than a cooking show, read on in this RedEye piece by Heather Schröering:

&quot; 'Historically in a lot of black and brown communities, coming together around the kitchen is a very holistic and spiritual experience,' said Eli Micky... The concept for the show made a lot of sense to [Aymar Jean Christian and McKinnon]: Film two artists from different backgrounds in a kitchen doing the things we all do in kitchens, hanging out, making snacks and having challenging conversations.

--

The most natural form of activism to McKinnon doesn’t live on the internet. It’s about gathering and celebrating black lives, something Two Queens in a Kitchen does well. 'Those true moments of healing don’t come from a tweet in my perspective,' they said. 'They come from those intimate, raw moments that can’t be edited or distilled.' &quot;

&quot;The show is not just written to center queer and trans people of color or non-normative folks; it’s also meant to affirm them. The supernatural aspect doesn’t just refer to them being witches or the psychic phenomenon. Supernatural also refers to the queer, women and people of color characters. It refers to their ability to live and understand themselves in a world they are marginalized in and on the receiving end of violence in. I hope it allows us to harness and embrace the power the struggle has given us and get people to start thinking more revolutionarily. I want this to be transformative.&quot;
