&quot;On the surface, people may say or assume the show was created for women, singles, people of color, South Asians, Indians, Indian-Americans or Brown people,&quot; explains Mohindra. &quot;But the show is a new take on the modern, American self-love story. Geeta's heartache, struggle to move forward and journey to self-acceptance is a story that is for everyone who has taken the risk to love—and who keep loving, despite the risk involved.&quot;
