On #Hollywood:
“The industry, historically, has been so afraid of identities that can’t be easily translated to a mainstream narrative,” Aymar Jean Christian said. “The lesson is to tell a good story with interesting characters who ring true to the people who are represented. It’s actually that simple.”

On #Chicago:
“I feel like Chicago has always been a place where you can semi-afford it still, still do your art outside of your day job in the way that LA and New York kind of doesn’t allow that,” Samantha Bailey said. “Chicago kind of sets that up and gives those characters a chance to figure things out in a way that if they lived in one of the cities we’re used to seeing on TV, it wouldn’t be as authentic.”",Link,,,06/15/2017 10:36:16 AM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,None

Co-creator Fatimah Asghar tells Brittany Julious: &quot;The web series is a small, small slice into the potential of the show. I want [the TV show] to be very Chicago-focused and queer folks of color–focused. And to have women of color and queer people of color be the protagonists and the antagonists in their own story. That's very important to me. I want to grow the show and make it more complicated and more nuanced. Tonally, we're trying to carry over the balance between comedy and those serious, weighted moments. The people of Brown Girls are not caricatures.&quot;

Co-creator Samantha Bailey says: &quot;Music was also part of our pitch. Chicago has an amazing music scene and we were lucky to include a bunch of artists in our series. All but one were Chicago-based and all of them were women of color. That's another way to change the gaze and the lens in how the series is seen. How does the music and the way it feels and the vibe of that city come from a woman's voice? We were lucky [HBO] was down for that.&quot;

All Open TV artists retain their intellectual property, so Open TV does not make any money off this sale or the distribution of the show. We will keep you posted on whether the web series will stay freely available on our site.",Link,,,06/05/2017 01:57:08 PM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,68,36.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,OTV|BG|OTV|OTV

We have 29 days to go, help make #SerialDreamer a reality and support queer, intersectional TV.

Serial Dreamer is an ambitious experiment in queer TV development: a series of pilots about intersectional characters. In the full series, each episode focuses on one of the co-op residents and we follow them in their everyday lives and jump into their dreams. Inspired as I was by dreaming while running to music, I imagine these worlds as music videos embedded in a serial narrative, but that may vary based on each artist’s vision and resources. Each episode will ideally have the same cinematographer but different directors and creative teams. Characters may show up in other series, or not. The relations in the show will be as organic as relationships in the real world.",Link,,,06/03/2017 11:18:28 AM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,9,1.0,,,,,,,,,,None

Created by founder Aymar Jean Christian in collaboration with a diverse group of Chicago artists from the #OpenTVCommunity, Serial Dreamer follows residents of a Chicago co-op in their everyday lives and their dreams.

Dr. Christian writes: 

Chicago’s artists inspired me to dream. A few years ago when I was new to Chicago, I would run down Lakeshore Drive, listening to R&amp;B and dreaming of televisual narratives. I was serially dreaming, casting as characters the artists who would eventually become my collaborators on Open TV (beta), a research project and web platform that I created to develop artistic, intersectional TV. With this campaign, I am asking you to support Serial Dreamer: Co-Op, a collaborative comedy pilot for a new series of stories about residents in a Chicago co-op as they dream about other worlds. The full series will follow a different character in each episode through their everyday life and their dreams. Each character and story line is created by a writer who has pitched or produced a project during Open TV's first two cycles or participated in the Open TV Writers Group during our residency at the Chicago Cultural Center. This project is an experiment in using queer TV development to mobilize our community and exponentially increase the number of artistic, intersectional TV stories coming out of Chicago. Serial Dreamer: Co-Op represents my dream for Open TV: ever-growing, ever-evolving, community-driven, and continually generating value from telling diverse stories.",Link,,,06/02/2017 02:54:20 PM, ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,5,1.0,,,,,,,,,,OTV|OTV|OTV
