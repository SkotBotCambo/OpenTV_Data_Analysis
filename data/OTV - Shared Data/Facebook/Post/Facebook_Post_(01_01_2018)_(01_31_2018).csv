&quot;This genocide of bodies was also accompanied by epistemicide - the erasure or repression of alternative channels of knowledge and thought to understand the universe. Europeans burnt the Islamic libraries of Grenada, of the Aztec and Incans, of African civilizations. and since the native women of Europe were illiterate and passed their knowledge through oral tradition they burnt their bodies because their bodies were the books.&quot;
