&quot;I co-wrote this series with two other gay men of colour – KB Woodson and Zak Payne. We all agreed that we wanted to touch on the rawness of the queer community which meant we had to tackle drugs. We also wanted to push what it looked like to be a person of colour in a white-dominated workplace, which is so important and something so many of us can relate to. We wanted to portray it in a way that highlights how awkward and uncomfortable it can be for us in those situations.&quot; - Vincent Martell, co-writer and director of #DamagedGoods",Link,,,03/26/2019 06:48:56 PM, ,344,344,0,464,464,0,14,5,6,0,0,421,308,0,0,13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,,,10,,,4,1.0,,,5,1.0,,,,,,,None

&quot;I've never seen proper representation of myself as a gay, Black man. We were tired of waiting for people to figure it out, so we took matters into our own hands. The representation we have seen is plastic — based off a white, Hollywood perspective and not authentic or relatable. Growing up without any proper characters on TV to look up to can be detrimental to someone's psyche, and we're just now seeing a shift in Hollywood where the people behind the lens are also in front of the lens. There's power in that, and artists around the world can connect with these experiences.&quot;

&quot;The relatively low economic barrier to producing web series versus industry pilots gets emerging 'creators in front of an audience, feedback from the audience, and builds the brand of the artist while building the audience,' says OTV founder Aymar Jean Christian, Ph.D. The creators also have more than one season, as opposed to just one pilot, to hone their projects. The result when it lands at a network is that 'these shows will show up in long-form more fully realized and more likely to be artistically cohesive and therefore last multiple seasons.'&quot;",Link,,,03/19/2019 12:37:39 PM, ,879,879,0,1239,1239,0,89,61,78,1,2,817,557,0,0,71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,43,5.0,2.0,46,5.0,2.0,48,14.0,,,64,14.0,,,,2.0,,1.0,None
