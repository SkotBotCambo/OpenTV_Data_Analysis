In the interview she discusses her art practice in relationship to the art world, including continuing work on her pilot Reality Is Not Good Enough, released on OTV in 2017!

“Writing is always embedded in my practice because there is a lot of writing embedded in performing, at least for me, and making films. It’s not about closing chapters, it’s about making what’s clear to me in my brain clear to other people. I have made a lot of work that refers to popular culture, to a certain kind of specific black, female interiority. And then I made a lot of work that deals with these broad, sweeping historical omissions and also the effects of colonization on the idea of identity. It’s about maintaining a certain specificity of my position and then expanding that to talk about the idea of attachment to identity.”",Link,,,08/29/2018 11:14:57 AM, ,214,214,0,240,240,0,28,23,39,0,0,175,157,0,0,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,7.0,,1,7.0,,20,10.0,,27,12.0,,,,RNGE|GE

“Seeds aims to be a ‘bold and dynamic narrative that explores their conversations through a hilariously authentic lens,’ and it succeeds in accomplishing that goal. Its cool style and unapologetic tone must be why the series was an Official Selection for the New York TV Festival Independent Pilot Competition, GlowFest and SeriesFest, where the series won Bustle's Best Emerging Female Creator Award.

Congrats to Brujos creator Ricardo Gamboa on this in-depth profile on the Chicago Reader. We are proud to co-host livestreams of the political talk show thanks in part to Voqal.

&quot;I'm Mexican-American in a country where Mexican-Americans account for less than 2 percent of all PhD holders,&quot; Gamboa [they/them] says. &quot;I'm finishing my doctorate right now, and it is unfair. I could cry right now thinking of all the smart people in my life who are just never going to get there. The obstacles for them to get there are so unfair. When I think about that stuff it's like, because I got access to this specific knowledge in this course, it's not like I got smarter.
