‚ÄúBrujos helps fill in an urgent need for representation, especially with so many of the most celebrated LGBTQ shows being dominated by cis white faces...The series is unapologetic and callous in its critique of hegemonic power. It is also an empowering portrayal of love, resilience, growth and strength. For queer brown kids who spent their childhood projecting themselves onto white TV characters, Brujos is the long awaited squad of heroes we have all been waiting for.‚Äù
