# TODO
* ~~Look at the spreadsheet data and see that it looks accurate~~
* Look into getting event information from Facebook
* what are the RSVPs looking like
* demographic info is helpful
* map of where the events have been
* info to get
    * RSVP info
    * Raw numbers
    * Demographics -> gender,age
    * How many people saw the event?
    * How many people were invited?
    * Any data on the post itself
    * posting to the event?
### Vimeo
* ~~graphs of individual programs by viewership by month.~~
* **Backfill null project id with the project id that other entries with the same URI have**
* retention rates over time
    * how should we define retention?
* going up or down?
* how many page loads / exposure
* views
* Look for inconsistencies
* having noticed retention rates downloaded but differ from what’s on the website
* Aggregated by program

### Additional Analyses
* organic vs. inorganic posting
* social network maps
* maybe start with the artist as their own social network
* Facebook as the most important platform
